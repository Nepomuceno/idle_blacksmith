    <h1>Privacy Policy for Idle Blacksmith</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Idle Blacksmith ("we", "our", or "the game") is committed to protecting your privacy. 
        This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile game.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Idle Blacksmith does not collect any personal information.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The game stores your progress locally on your device. This data never leaves your device 
        and is not transmitted to any servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The following data is stored locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Game progress (gold, items forged, upgrades purchased)</li>
        <li>Achievements unlocked</li>
        <li>Settings preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored in your device's app data folder and can be deleted by uninstalling the game.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Advertising (Currently Disabled):</strong> The game may include optional advertising 
        in future updates. If enabled, ads will be served through Google AdMob, which has its own 
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>. You will be notified 
        if advertising is enabled through an app update.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Idle Blacksmith is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information 
        from children. Since we don't collect any personal information from anyone, this applies 
        equally to users of all ages.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all game data is stored locally on your device, data security depends on your 
        device's security settings. We recommend using device-level security features like 
        passcodes or biometric authentication.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected 
        in the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the game 
        after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.
    </p>
